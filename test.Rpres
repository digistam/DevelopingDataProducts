Social Network Analysis
========================================================
Social network analysis (SNA) is the use of network theory to analyse social networks. Social network analysis views social relationships in terms of network theory, consisting of nodes, representing individual actors within the network. These networks are often depicted in a Graph, where nodes are represented as points and edges are represented as lines...
Example Graph
========================================================

```{r, echo=FALSE}
if (!require("igraph")) {
  install.packages("igraph", repos="http://cran.rstudio.com/") 
  library("igraph") 
}
a <- c('Donald','Goofy','Minnie','Donald','Goofy')
b <- c('Mickey','Minnie','Mickey','Minnie')
c <- as.data.frame(cbind(a,b))
g <- graph.data.frame(c, directed = F)
V(g)$size=degree(g)*10
V(g)$color=degree(g)+1
V(g)$label.cex <- degree(g)
set.seed(111)
layout1 <- layout.fruchterman.reingold(g)
plot(g, layout = layout1)
```
Graph information
========================================================
The Graph explorer will show some important details about the network,
like who's connected to who and which nodes have an higher degree than other nodes
```{r, echo=FALSE}
as.matrix(get.adjacency(g))
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
ddf <- sort(degree(g), decreasing = T)
ddf <- as.data.frame(ddf)
names(ddf) <- c('degree rank') 
ddf
```
