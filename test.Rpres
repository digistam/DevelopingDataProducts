Social Network Analysis
========================================================
Social network analysis (SNA) is the use of network theory to analyse social networks. Social network analysis views social relationships in terms of network theory, consisting of nodes, representing individual actors within the network. These networks are often depicted in a Graph, where __nodes__ (or _vertices_) are represented as points and __edges__ are represented as lines.

__Graph explorer__, a web application running on the __Shiny server__ framework, takes a CSV file with nodes as input. The output is a visual analysis of connections and degrees.

Example
========================================================
![csv file](csv.jpg)
```{r, echo=FALSE}
if (!require("igraph")) {
  install.packages("igraph", repos="http://cran.rstudio.com/") 
  library("igraph") 
}
a <- c('Donald','Goofy','Minnie','Donald','Goofy')
b <- c('Mickey','Minnie','Mickey','Minnie')
c <- as.data.frame(cbind(a,b))
g <- graph.data.frame(c, directed = F)
V(g)$size=degree(g)*10
V(g)$color=degree(g)+1
V(g)$label.cex <- degree(g)
set.seed(111)
layout1 <- layout.fruchterman.reingold(g)
plot(g, layout = layout1)
```

example csv file and Graph output

Graph information
========================================================
Graph explorer will show some important details about the network,
like who's connected to who and which nodes have an higher degree than other nodes. 
```{r, echo=FALSE}
as.matrix(get.adjacency(g))
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
ddf <- sort(degree(g), decreasing = T)
ddf <- as.data.frame(ddf)
names(ddf) <- c('degree rank') 
ddf
```
